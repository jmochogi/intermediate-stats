Tibbles are same as data frames but with several advantages such as\n\nThey load faster than data frames.\nAllow use of non-standard variable names (i.e., variables can have sapces and can start with a number)\nAllow you to have columns as lists.\n\nTo import the data set into your work space, use the command read_csv() which imports the data as a tibble. So you know, the command read.csv() loads data as a data frame. As noted earlier, the data is stored on a website and we have the link (URL). Use the command below to load the data into your workspace. Note that we are naming the data nhanes_samp_adult_500.\nIf you data loads properly, it is highly recommended that you take some time to study it so you understand its context and variables. Doing this will make your analyses easier and interpretations will be meaningful.",

    "text": "Problem 1 (Linear Regression)\nSeveral studies point out that maintaining a healthy weight is an important part of well being. The goal in this problem is to identify, via linear regression, the most important factors that can determine someone’s weight. Here is a list of the variables you will consider in this problem:\nPhysActive: A categorical variable coded as Yes if the participant does moderate or vigorous-intensity sports, fitness, or recreational activities, and No if otherwise.\nHeight: A numerical variable measuring height in cm.\nSleepHrsNight: A numerical variable representing the average sleep time per night in hours.\nAgeMonths: A numerical variable giving someone’s age in months.\nMaritalStatus: A categorical variable with levels Divorced, LivePartner, Married, NeverMarried, Separated, and Widowed.\nEducation: A categorical variable with levels 8th Grade 9 - 11th Grade, High School, Some College, and College Grad.\nGender: a categorical variable with levels female, male.\nAs we have learned in this course, having a lot of predictors does not necessarily mean you have a great model. You are going to start by fitting a model with all predictors listed above and then perform model selection (backward elimination) to come up with the ‘’best model’’ for predicting weight.\n\nCreate a model for predicting weight based on all variables in the list above. Based on this model, what factor has the most influence on weight? What factor has the least influence?\nWhat is the R-squared value of the model in part (a) above? Interpret the value in the context of the data.\nPerform model selection (backward elimination) to come up with the ‘’best model’’ for predicting weight. Write down the equation of the model. You do not need to show all the steps of the backward elimination process but you should explain these steps here in brief.\nInterpret the intercept and all slopes in the final model from part (c).\nExamine the first case in the data set. Does your model underestimate or overestimate the weight of the individual? By how much?",

A common measure for determining whether someone is overweight is the Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a measure that accounts for both weight and height of an individual and is computed as follows:\n\\[BMI=\\frac{Weight}{(Height)^2}\\]\nWhere weight is measured in Kilograms and Height is measured in meters.\nIn this problem, you will use the same data set used in problem 1 to run a model for the likelihood of diabetes based on BMI, Age, and Gender. Note that the variable Diabetes is categorical with levels Yes and No.\n\nCreate a regression model (name it Diabetes_Model) for predicting whether someone has diabetes or not based on their BMI, Age, and Gender.

    "text": "Assessment\nYour learning will be assessed in a variety of ways including Attendance and Participation (AP), CPA’s, Labs, Problem Sets (PS), Projects, Exams, and a final Portfolio (takes the place of a final exam). Below are the details on these components.\n\nAttendance and Participation (AP)\nYou’re expected to attend all classes and participate during class discussions. Consistent attendance and participation are strong indicators of success in MAT 246. You will be responsible for all course material, announcements, quizzes, and exams made in class, whether you attended that day’s class or not. I may post the announcements and materials on Canvas and/or send them out as emails. If you anticipate needing to miss more than four class sessions, please make an appointment with me to discuss any restrictions on your availability early in the semester so we can find ways for you to participate and be successful in the course. Your attendance & participation will be gauged based on the following metrics:\n\nPunctuality to class and number of classes attended\nPreparedness for class (you will generally be considered prepared if you do the CPAs)\nLevel of engagement: Includes working collaboratively with others, sharing your thoughts during class discussions, and asking/answering questions.\nContributing to online collaboration work and discussion forums.\n\nFor a more detailed rubric on how attendance and participation will be graded, click on this link.\nFor more details about the college attendance policy, see the college-wide policies section.\n\n\nClass Preparation Assignments (CPAs)\nCPAs are done prior to class. They involve completing short readings or activities and/or watching videos then answering a few questions based on the covered material. CPA’s are meant to get you prepared for the material of the week/day so that you can contribute meaningfully during class discussions. For this reason, deadlines for CPAs cannot be extended.\nNote: CPAs will generally be graded for completion and effort. From time to time, there will be one question on the CPA that will be graded for accuracy. This question is meant to gauge the extent to which you understood the material on your own and answers may be discussed in class.\n\n\nProblem sets (PSs)\nProblem sets will be assigned after every three to four weeks or after completion of a major topic. Unlike the CPAs, the problem sets will be more open-ended, non-routine, and with a heavy emphasis on real life applications of the material learned. You are encouraged to consult with your classmates on the problems but write your own solutions. You may also come in for Student hours for further help if you need it. Do not wait until the deadline day to start your problem set.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply what you’ve learned in during class to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, lab should be completed and submitted individually. Lab assignments must be typed up using Quarto, all work must be rendered to pdf format and must be submitted on Canvas by the deadline.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will be a short quiz in class almost every week (Fridays). The quiz will be based mainly on material learned in the CPA and/or discussed in class for the current or previous week. To do well in these quizzes, you should complete your CPAs accurately, and attend class. If there are concepts you have questions about, be sure to ask. All Quizzes will be closed book and closed notes.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be two group projects for this class. For every project, a short proposal will be due roughly a week after the project is assigned. Your group will have 10-15 minutes to present your work in class and then submit the project report a day after presentation. Detailed information about the project, including a grading rubric, will be provided.\n\n\nMidterm Exams\nThere will be two mid-term exams during the semester. Each midterm exam will have an in class component and a take-home component.\n\nIn-class component: The in-class component will be closed-book and closed notes but calculators will be allowed (not on devices like cellphones and computers). You will be allowed to bring a 2-sided A4 size cheatsheet paper for the in-person component. These will be submitted alongside the exam.\nThe take-home component May require use of RStudio and will be availed in quarto (qmd) format. You will need to type in your answers into the quarto document and perform the analyses accordingly. You should submit a pdf format but if you face errors rendering due to errors in your code, you may submit the .qmd file.\n\nThe exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in CPAs, problem sets, quizzes, among others.\n\n\nFinal Portfolio\nThe final portfolio will consist of the following:\n\nRevised work (if necessary) on both mid-term exams. Again, you should point out the errors on every problem and explain how the revisions address the errors.\nRevised work (if necessary) on 2 problem sets with the lowest grades. Again, you need to have reflective statements on each problem.\nA reflective essay on your main takeaways from the course and how you may implement that knowledge in your field or other real-life situations.\n\nThe final portfolio will be due on the day at time of your final exam for this course.\n\n\nGrading Policy\nYour final letter grade in the course will be weighted by category as follows:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\n__\n\n\nClass Preparation Assignments\n10%\n\n\nProblem Sets\n15%\n\n\nLabs\n15%\n\n\nQuizzes\n10%\n\n\nMidterm Exams\n20%\n\n\nProjects\n15%\n\n\nFinal Portfolio\n15%\n\n\n\nThe final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nFinal Course Grade\n\n\n\n\nA\n\\(\\ge\\) 93\n\n\nA-\n90 - 92.99\n\n\nB+\n87 - 89.99\n\n\nB\n83 - 86.99\n\n\nB-\n80 - 82.99\n\n\nC+\n77 - 79.99\n\n\nC\n73 - 76.99\n\n\nC-\n70 - 72.99\n\n\nD+\n67 - 69.99\n\n\nD\n63 - 66.99\n\n\nD-\n60 - 62.99\n\n\nF\n\\(&lt;\\) 60",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nThe point is very simple - you should not cheat. You should not present “someone” else’s work as your own.\nAbide by the following guidelines:\n\nCollaboration:\n\nWork that is not assigned as a collaborative assignment should not be completed collaboratively. This does not mean you should not seek support from peers. If you seek help from your peers, be sure that you write your own solutions, otherwise the work will be similar and flagged for cheating. Submitting similar work will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy by all students involved.\nFor team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. Each group will submit one document contained agreed upon responses. No multiple file submissions.\n\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share work with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share work with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: In this century, the internet is a go to place for many things. While much of the information on the internet is useful, I expect that you will use it responsibly. The course policy is that you may use online resources (e.g., StackOverflow, Wolfram Alpha, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any solutions you directly use (or use as inspiration).\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT should be treated as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Using AI tools should make you more efficient and productive rather than hampering your ability to think clearly and critically.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. AI is an integral part of this course and we will practice using generative AI tools responsibly without losing sight of the learning objectives.\n✅ AI tools for code: We will use GitHub Copilot for code generation in this course. However, we will only start using this tool after you have gained a basic understanding of the coding and syntax. While coding uses highly specified formats and even minor errors can cause problems, using github copilot can be thought of as “coding in English”. You will just need to prompt the tool effectively. You should also examine the code output as much as possible. One way to do this is to look at the output (if available) and work backwards. More details on this to follow.\n\nYou may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n\n❌ AI tools for narrative: You may not use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT to write narrative on assignments. Interpretation of software output, writing up the project report, among others should be written by a human (YOU). If you want to use these tools to check your grammar, you should feel free to do so but be sure to disclose and cite it accordingly.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please contact your instructor.\n\n\nLate Work\nThe due date & time for all assignments will be posted on Canvas and/or emailed out and/or announced in class. To enable me to prepare for class meetings and give you feedback, I will not accept late work except under extreme circumstances. If you know that you won’t be able to turn in an assignment on time, reach out to me in writing (email) at least one day before the due date to discuss your options. Note that there will be no extensions on CPA’s.\n\n\nMobile devices & Other Technologies\nThis class allows use of technology devices (e.g., computers, tablets, etc.) only for purposes of the course. Such purpose involves data analysis, writing reports, completing OneNote collaborative activities, among others. However, there will be moments (e.g., brief interactive discussion, completing paper activities,) when I require that students put away (or turn off) their technology devices. Use of these devices for purposes other than the one for the course is prohibited. Research on this matter shows that it distracts you as well as other students in class. Two violations per week will result in a 0 score on the next attendance and participation grade. Persistent violation may necessitate further action to prevent you from distracting other students.\n\n\nTeams\nThis class will mostly run through small group work (teams). You will be randomly assigned to a team at the start of the semester. About midway into the semester, I will switch people teams based partly on my professional judgement. I will allow you to suggest members you would like to work with but there are no guarantees that you will get grouped with all members of your choice. I generally seek to have mixed ability teams and to ensure that everyone has a chance to work with different people.",

    "text": "Tips for Success\nHere are a few basic suggestions for how to succeed in this course:\n\nKeep up with Homework\nIt is absolutely essential that you understand how to solve the assigned homework problems/exercises and, more importantly, how and why the skills and techniques presented in the course are used in solving the problems/exercises. I suggest that you begin working on the how as soon as possible. Do not pile your haw or work near the deadline. The advantage of getting the homework done on time is that you will get timely feedback that will help you understand the material better and hence do well in other assessment categories such as exams.\n\n\nAttend Class\nAs noted earlier, attendance is a critical part of your success in this course. You should try to attend every class because it is during class time that we will delve deeper into the course material and practice with applications.\n\n\nStay Caught Up\nMost concepts in this course build on each other cumulatively and you need to stay on top of the material at every stage. If you are having difficulty, don’t expect that the problem will take care of itself and disappear later. Contact me immediately and discuss the problem.\n\n\nCollaborate with Peers\nMany students benefit from sharing their work with others or by having their work questioned by their peers. You should attempt homework problems ahead of time by yourself and then note down any difficulties/questions that you can discuss with your peers. Even if you have no difficulties, you may still learn different and perhaps more efficient ways of solving the same problem during collaborative work. Below are some of the ways through which you can do this: - Canvas Discussion Forums & One Note Collaboration Space - You can post questions and answer others’ questions here. I encourage you to scan hand-written work (if necessary) and upload it alongside your question so people can see how you are thinking.\n\nZoom sessions – If you cannot meet in person, you can initiate Zoom sessions for collaborating. Zoom whiteboards are available to write on or you may simply have discussions. You can record these for later playback. If you want to invite me to your Zoom session, please send me an email with the link ahead of time and I will let you know if I am available to join.",

    "text": "College-wide Policies\n\nAttendance Policy\nStudents at Ithaca College are expected to attend all classes, and they are responsible for work missed during any absence from class. At the beginning of each semester, instructors must provide the students in their courses with written guidelines regarding possible penalties for failure to attend class. These guidelines may vary from course to course but are subject to the following conditions:\n\nIn accordance with Federal Law, students with a disability documented through Student Accessibility Services (SAS) may require reasonable accommodations to ensure equitable access. A student with an attendance accommodation, who misses a scheduled course time due to a documented disability, must be provided an equivalent opportunity to make up missed time and/or coursework within a reasonable time-frame. An accommodation that affects attendance is not an attendance waiver and no accommodation can fundamentally alter a course requirement. If a faculty member thinks an attendance-related accommodation would result in a fundamental alteration, concerns and potential alternatives should be discussed with SAS.\nIn accordance with New York State law, students who miss class due to their religious beliefs shall be excused from class or examinations on that day. The faculty member is responsible for providing the student with an equivalent opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirement that the student may have missed. Any such work is to be completed within a reasonable time frame, as determined by the faculty member.\nAny student who misses class due to a family or individual health emergency or to a required appearance in a court of law shall be excused. If the emergency is prolonged or if the student is incapacitated, the student or a family member/legal guardian should report the absence to the Dean of Students or the Dean of the academic school where the student’s program is housed. Students may consider a leave of absence, medical leave of absence, selected course withdrawals, etc., if they miss a significant portion of classwork. (Note: Graduate students may not take a leave of absence.)\nA student may be excused to participate in local, state, or federal elections. The student is responsible to make up any work that is missed due to the absence. Any such work is to be completed within a reasonable time frame, as determined by the faculty member.\n\nA student may be excused for participation in College-authorized co-curricular and extracurricular activities if, in the instructor’s judgment, this does not impair the specific student’s or the other students’ ability to succeed in the course. For all absences except those due to religious beliefs, the course instructor has the right to determine if the number of absences has been excessive in view of the nature of the class that was missed and the stated attendance policy.\nStudents should notify their instructors as soon as possible of any anticipated absences.\n\n\nStudent Accessibility Services\nIn compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, reasonable accommodation will be provided to students with documented disabilities on a case-by-case basis. Students must register with Student Accessibility Services and provide appropriate documentation to Ithaca College before any academic adjustment will be provided. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive, so timely contact with Student Accessibility Services is encouraged. To discuss accommodations or the accommodation process, students should schedule to meet with a SAS specialist. 607-274-1005 | sas@ithaca.edu.\n\n\nMental Health statement\nThe Ithaca College Center for Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) promotes and fosters the academic, personal, and interpersonal development of Ithaca College students by providing short-term individual, group, and relationship counseling, crisis intervention, educational programs to the campus community, and consultation for faculty, staff, parents, and students. Their team of licensed and licensed-eligible professionals value inclusivity, and they are dedicated to creating a diverse, accessible, and welcoming environment that is safe and comfortable for all those they serve and with whom they interact. CAPS sees students in-person at their offices in the Hammond Health building (side entrance), but Telehealth meetings through Zoom can be arranged in some circumstances. Staff in the office will answer questions by phone at 607-274-3136; please leave a voicemail if you do not reach a live person. You can also reach the office via email at counseling@ithaca.edu. CAPS hours remain Monday-Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. After-hours connections to a live counselor are available by calling the CAPS number and following the prompts.\nIn the event I suspect you need additional support, expect that I will express to you my concerns. It is not my intent to know the details of what might be troubling you, but simply to let you know I am concerned and that help, if needed, is available. Remember, getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe College is an academic community, which values academic integrity and takes seriously its responsibility for upholding academic honesty. All members of the academic community have an obligation to uphold high intellectual and ethical standards. All forms of dishonesty including cheating and plagiarism are unacceptable. Failure to appropriately cite material used in a paper is plagiarism. The minimum penalty for cheating or plagiarism is a zero for the test or paper in question. Referral to college judiciaries is also possible. For more information on academic integrity and academic dishonesty, please refer to the Student Handbook, the College Catalog and the Code of Student Conduct and Related Policies or ask your instructor.\n\n\nTitle IX\nAt Ithaca College, we believe that every individual has the right to be treated with respect and dignity and we support the creation and maintenance of a safe and positive living and learning environment. Students who experience sexual violence (including dating violence, stalking and sexual assault), sexual harassment, or discrimination based on gender or sexual identity) are encouraged to report their experience to the Title IX Coordinator, lkoenig@ithaca.edu to explore formal and informal reporting options, and explore the support and resources available. The Title IX Coordinator will work with you to determine the best way to proceed and enhance the safety of our community. For more information go to: https://www.ithaca.edu/share.\nInformation shared in class assignments, class discussions, and at public events do not constitute an official disclosure, and faculty and staff do not have to report these to the Title IX Coordinator. Faculty and staff should be sure that access to campus and community resources related to sexual misconduct are available to students in the case these subjects do arise. Any other disclosure to faculty and staff can be reported to the Title IX Coordinator.\n\n\nAcademic Advising Center\nStudents are asked to consult with their faculty advisor, or the advising contact within their school, for all advising matters. Faculty advisors will be able to assist students with most advising questions, or they may collaborate with the dean’s office for more complicated matters. Students can find the name of their assigned faculty advisor in Homer or in Degree Works.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nIthaca College values diversity because it enriches our community and the myriad experiences that characterize an Ithaca College education. Diversity encompasses multiple dimensions, including but not limited to race, culture, nationality, ethnicity, religion, ideas, beliefs, geographic origin, class, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, disability, and age. We are dedicated to addressing current and past injustices and promoting excellence and equity. Ithaca College continually strives to build an inclusive and welcoming community of individuals with diverse talents and skills from a multitude of backgrounds who are committed to civility, mutual respect, social justice, and the free and open exchange of ideas. We commit ourselves to change, growth, and actions that embrace diversity as an integral part of the educational experience and of the community we create.Please learn more about Ithaca College’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion: https://www.ithaca.edu/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for syllabus bounty!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve read this far in the syllabus, please email me a picture of your favorite scene in Ithaca or its environs if you have one. If not, just describe the place. I will include you on my special list of most serious students.",

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the course TA are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the posit cloud. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"xxx\"), where xxx is the name of the package.\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the online computing environment (posit cloud).",

It should also provide a brief overview of the data you are using and the analyses you plan to conduct. Cite a few sources that are relevant to your research topic.\nLiterature Review: This section should provide a brief overview of the literature related to your research topic. You should cite at least 5 sources and synthesize their methods and findings in relation to your own research. Guidelines for writing an effective literature review can be found here.\nMethods: This section should describe the data you are using and the analyses you plan to conduct. It should include the following subsections:\n\nData Description: This section should describe the data you are using. This should include the source of the data, the number of observations and variables, and a brief description of the variables and their types (e.g., numerical, categorical).

In this case, you are allowed to speculate (reasonably) on the data collection process and be sure to mention that in your proposal.\nResearch Questions and Analyses: This section should list the research questions you are addressing. You should also describe the variables of interest in your data set that will help you answer these questions. Discuus the methids you plan to use for each question and why you think they are appropriate.\nData Cleaning: This section should describe the steps you took to clean the data. This may include removing missing values, transforming variables, etc. Depending on your data set, you may not need to do much data cleaning. If this is the case, you should still describe the steps you took to clean the data, even if they are minimal.\n\nData Analysis and Results: This is one of the most important heavily weighted parts of your project. The analyses should be sound and justified appropriately (under methods). Here, you just need to implement the analyses described under the methodology section of your paper. Your analyses should demonstrate a thorough understanding of statistical concepts learned in this course (and beyond, if you like). Your data analyses must include both numerical statistics and data visualizations. You must also use regression modelling (linear or logistic) techniques as part of your analyses. Interpretations of visualizations created as well as the models created must be made in a coherent manner and in the context of the research questions. These are the results/findings of your project.\nConclusion: This section should summarize the research questions you addressed, the data you used, the analyses you conducted, and the results you obtained. Findings of your study must be tied back to those reported in the literature review; for example, do your findings concur with previous studies or do they contradict them? It should also discuss the implications of your results and suggest directions for future research. Be sure to state any limitations of your study and what would be done differently if you were to do the study again.\nReferences: This section should list all the sources you cited in your report. Use APA format for your references.\n\nInstructions and grading criteria for this milestone are outlined in Milestone 2: Proposal.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this lab, we’ll be analyzing data from the Human Freedom Index (HFI) reports. The data frame is contained within the openintro package that we have already installed. We will start by doing some basic data transformations (data wrangling), then proceed to summarize a few of the relationships within the data both graphically and numerically in order to find which variables can help tell a story about freedom.\n\n\nCreate a new Quarto document with the title Data Transformations and Linear Regression. Change the output format to pdf (note that it is set to html by default). Refer to lab_00_Guide if you don’t remember how to create a new quarto file. Save the file as lab_02.\nNote that if you created the file correctly, it should appear under files with a .qmd extension(i.e., lab_02.qmd). If you do not have this file exactly as described, please stop and make sure you have it done correctly before you proceed.\nAfter correctly creating the file, click on Render to see the output in pdf format. Note that it may pop up in a new window. You may want to delete the content that comes with the quarto template before you proceed.\n\nIn this lab, you will need four packages: openintro, tidyverse, statsr, and broom. Recall that we have installed the first two but not the last two. So, we start by installing statsr and broom. Run the following code in the console. Note that we are installing multiple packages on one step:\ninstall.packages(\"statsr\", \"broom\")\nAfter installing the two packages, open a code chunk within your quarto document and load all packages needed using the following code:\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(statsr)\nlibrary(broom)\nRun the code chunk with the packages to ensure that they are all working correctly. Remember to disable the library code output in your rendered pdf from quarto. You may use include=FALSE option.\n\nAs indicated earlier, the data we will work with is called hfi (human freedom index) and is part of the openintro package. All we need to do is create a code chunk and load the data into our quarto file using the following command:\n\nCodedata(hfi)\n\n\nOnce you run the above command, you should be able to see a new object called hfi in the environment area. Click on it to examine the data.\nYou can learn more about the data by running the following command in the console:\n?hfi\nQuestion: How many variables and how many observations are the hfi dataframe?\n\nIt is often claimed that data scientists spend nearly 80 percent of their time getting their data into an easily usable format. This process is often referred to as data wrangling and is quite broad. We are going to learn about a few basic functions that you can use to perform basic data transformations. These include:\n\nselect\nmutate\nfilter\narrange\ngroup_by\ndrop_na\n\n\nThe select function is used to select specific variables (columns) from a larger data set.\nAs you should have noticed, the hfi data frame is very big. Suppose you are only interested in the variables region, pf_expression_control and pf_score. We can use the select function to create a new data frame that has only these three variables. It if often advisable to have a new name for you new data frame. If you use the same name as the original, it will overwrite the original data frame. I have chosen to use the name hfi_new. Run the code below:\n\nCodehfi_new &lt;- hfi %&gt;% \nselect (region,pf_expression_control , pf_score)\n# Pipe hfi into the select function and specify the variables of interest.\n\n\nNote:\n\nBe sure to take a moment to make sure you understand what the code is doing.\nAfter running the above code, a new data frame (hfi_new) should appear in the environment area. Click to make sure it is what you expect to see.\n\nThe mutate function is used for creating a new variable by altering (mutating) existing variable(s) in some way. Suppose, for example, let us say you wanted to convert the expression control variable (pf_expression_control) to percentages. We know that the expression control is measured out of 10. So we can divide each score by 10 and multiply by 100. Use the code below. We will name the new data frame as hfi_new_1:\n\nCodehfi_new_2 &lt;- hfi_new %&gt;% \nmutate(pf_exp_cont_percent= (pf_expression_control/10)*100)\n# The new data frame will now have 4 variables.\n\n\nNote - The new data frame (hfi_new_2) now has 4 variables. - If you wanted to delete the original variable, you can use transmute instead of mutate. - The above example assumes that variable being mutated is numerical, otherwise, the operation may not be possible. How do you mutate a categorical variable?\n\nThe operations we have considered so far focus on columns (variables). We can also work on cases (rows). The filter function is used to choose rows that meet certain characteristics that you may be interested in. Suppose, for example, that we are interested in countries from Eastern Europe only. Let us create a new data frame (call it hfi_new_3) from hfi_new_2. Use the code below:\n\nCodehfi_new_3 &lt;- hfi_new_2 %&gt;% \nfilter (region == \"Eastern Europe\")\n\n\nNote - As expected, the new data frame has only 198 cases (rows). - The number of columns (variables) stays the same as in hfi_new2.\nIf you wanted countries from Eastern Europe OR from Western Europe. To do this, you separate the regions using a | as shown below:\n\nCodehfi_new_4 &lt;- hfi_new_2 %&gt;% \nfilter (region == \"Eastern Europe\"| region== \"Western Europe\")\n\n\n\nGroup_by is a special kind of filtering that is commonly used alongside a summarize function. Suppose you want to compute the average freedom score (pf_score) by region. You can achieve this by piping the data into a group_by function that will group the data according to your wish and then call the summarize function. Run the code below:\n\nCodehfi_new_4 %&gt;% \n  group_by (region) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean(pf_score))\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the code did not return a value for Eastern Europe. This is because there are some missing values in the data for Eastern Europe. To fix this, you can add one more step in the workflow that will drop the NA values from the pf_score variable. See below:\n\nCodehfi_new_4 %&gt;%\n  drop_na(pf_score)%&gt;% # This is the new step\n  group_by (region) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean(pf_score))\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen from the hfi documentation (obtained by running ?hfi in the console), the variable pf_score measures the personal freedom score of a country. The higher the score a country has on pf_score, the more the personal freedoms enjoyed by its people. On the other hand, the variable pf_expression_control measures the extent to which countries place political pressure and controls on the media content. A low score on pf_expression_control means higher controls and political pressure.\nWhat is the relationship between personal freedom score (pf_score) and the personal freedom expression control (pf_expression_contro l) for Western and Eastern European countries? To answer this question, we can create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship. We will use the hfi_new_4 data frame. Use the code below:\n\nCodeggplot(data=hfi_new_4, mapping=aes(x=pf_expression_control, y=pf_score))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nFrom the above scatter plot, we see an increasing (positive) linear trend where countries with low pressure on media (i.e., high score on pf_expression_control) tend to have higher personal freedoms (high scores on pf_score) and vice versa. Furthermore, the relationship appears to be fairly strong with a few suspected outliers on the lower side.\nIn your code above, change the geom_point to geom_jitter. What do you notice?\n\nThe correlation coefficient gives us a numerical measure of the association between two (numerical) variables. It tells us the strength and direction of the association. See the Tidyverse workflow below for doing this:\n\nCodehfi_new_4 %&gt;%\n  drop_na(pf_score, pf_expression_control)%&gt;%\n  summarize(cor(pf_score,pf_expression_control))\n# Notice we first dropped missing values from the two variables\n\n\nYou can also use base R (non-Tidyverse) code as follows but this is generally difficult to read/decode.\n\nCodecor(hfi_new_4$pf_score, hfi_new_4$pf_expression_control, use=\"complete.obs\")\n# Notice we first dropped missing values from the two variables\n\n\nIt is often helpful to generate both scatter plots and correlation coefficient in order to get a complete picture of the relationship.\n\nSuppose we want to use the pf_expression_control variable (predictor) to estimate the values of personal freedom score (pf_score). We can do this by fitting a least squares regression line. We use a function called lm (for linear model) as follows:\n\nCodemodel &lt;- lm(pf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data =hfi_new_4)\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe variable that comes after the ~ is ALWAYS the predictor variable (or x-variable).\nAfter setting the relationship, we must specify the data set. Here we use hfi_new_4.\nWe saved this model as an object called model because we will need it later. This means we won’t have to write the code all over again when we need it.\nTo see the model output, you can click on the object named model in the environment area and identify the slope and intercept for your model.\n\nIt is often useful to visualize the line of best fit. You can achieve this by running the following ggplot commands:\n\nCodeggplot(data =hfi_new_4, aes(x =pf_expression_control, y =pf_score))+ \n  geom_jitter() + \n  geom_smooth(method =\"lm\", se=FALSE, color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model output seen earlier contains too much information which makes it hard to find what you need. In most cases, we are interested in the intercept, the slope, and perhaps the p-values (for statistical inference). To get a cleaner looking model output, we use the tidy function (contained in broom package. Create a code chunk and run the code below:\n\nCodetidy(model)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term                  estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)              6.13     0.0791      77.5 1.85e-222\n2 pf_expression_control    0.354    0.0108      32.9 3.44e-109\n\n\nNote:\n\nIf you had not saved the object model you would have to write the code all over again and use that code in place of model in the tidy function above.\nThe formula for the model is \\[\\widehat{ef\\_score}=6.131+0.354 \\times pf\\_expression\\_control\\]\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nIntercept: On average, the estimated freedom score (ef_score) for a countries with absolute political pressure and control on the media (i.e., pf_expression_control of 0) would be 6.131.\nSlope: Every time we reduce the political control on the media (pf_expression_control) by one unit, the personal freedom score (pf_score) increases by 0.354 on average.\n\nFinally, we can assess model fit using a statistic called coefficient of determination (aka R-squared). This statistic gives the proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the explanatory variable. We use the glance() function for this. Use the code below:\n\nCodeglance(model)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic   p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0.756         0.755 0.359     1083. 3.44e-109     1  -138.  283.  294.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe \\(R^2\\) value is .7558. This means that up to 75.58% of variability in the personal freedom scores for the countries can be accounted for by the model with pf_expression_control as the predictor.\n\nWe can also run a regression analysis using a categorical variable. Suppose we want to pf_score by country. We want to focus on Western vs Eastern Europe so we will use hfi_new_4 data frame. Before we create anything, we may want to visualize the relationship by way of a scatter plot. You can use the geom_point or the geom_jitter to shake them up a little.\n\nCodeggplot(data=hfi_new_4, aes(x=region, y=pf_score))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Try switching geom_point to geom_jitter and see what happens.\n\n\n\nBased on the scatter plot, how would you describe the relationship between region and pf_score?\n\nWhen you have a categorical variable, you may create side-by-side box plots. These are great in comparing the distribution of the numerical variable variable by category. Use the code below:\n\nCodeggplot(data=hfi_new_4, aes(x=region, y=pf_score))+\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship based on the side-by-side box plots.\n\nTo fit a linear model, we use the same code as in the case of two numerical variables. We know that region is the predictor and `pf_score is the outcome. Go region comes after the ~ sign. See code below:\n\nCodemodel_2 &lt;- lm(pf_score ~ region, data =hfi_new_4)\n\n\nYou can then tidy the model using the code:\n\nCodetidy(model_2)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term                 estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)             8.24     0.0412     200.  0       \n2 regionWestern Europe    0.910    0.0607      15.0 1.50e-39\n\n\nThe formula for the model can be written as: \\[\\widehat{ef\\_score}=8.24+0.91 \\times region\\_WesternEurope\\]\nQuestion:\n\nWhy do we have region_WesternEurope in the model instead of the expected variable name (i.e., region)?\nInterpret the slope and the intercept in context.\n\nYou may want to create a new quarto file for the exercises.

    "text": "It is often claimed that data scientists spend nearly 80 percent of their time getting their data into an easily usable format. This process is often referred to as data wrangling and is quite broad. We are going to learn about a few basic functions that you can use to perform basic data transformations. These include:\n\nselect\nmutate\nfilter\narrange\ngroup_by\ndrop_na\n\n\nThe select function is used to select specific variables (columns) from a larger data set.\nAs you should have noticed, the hfi data frame is very big. Suppose you are only interested in the variables region, pf_expression_control and pf_score. We can use the select function to create a new data frame that has only these three variables. It if often advisable to have a new name for you new data frame. If you use the same name as the original, it will overwrite the original data frame. I have chosen to use the name hfi_new. Run the code below:\n\nCodehfi_new &lt;- hfi %&gt;% \nselect (region,pf_expression_control , pf_score)\n# Pipe hfi into the select function and specify the variables of interest.\n\n\nNote:\n\nBe sure to take a moment to make sure you understand what the code is doing.\nAfter running the above code, a new data frame (hfi_new) should appear in the environment area. Click to make sure it is what you expect to see.\n\nThe mutate function is used for creating a new variable by altering (mutating) existing variable(s) in some way. Suppose, for example, let us say you wanted to convert the expression control variable (pf_expression_control) to percentages. We know that the expression control is measured out of 10. So we can divide each score by 10 and multiply by 100. Use the code below. We will name the new data frame as hfi_new_1:\n\nCodehfi_new_2 &lt;- hfi_new %&gt;% \nmutate(pf_exp_cont_percent= (pf_expression_control/10)*100)\n# The new data frame will now have 4 variables.\n\n\nNote - The new data frame (hfi_new_2) now has 4 variables. - If you wanted to delete the original variable, you can use transmute instead of mutate. - The above example assumes that variable being mutated is numerical, otherwise, the operation may not be possible. How do you mutate a categorical variable?\n\nThe operations we have considered so far focus on columns (variables). We can also work on cases (rows). The filter function is used to choose rows that meet certain characteristics that you may be interested in. Suppose, for example, that we are interested in countries from Eastern Europe only. Let us create a new data frame (call it hfi_new_3) from hfi_new_2. Use the code below:\n\nCodehfi_new_3 &lt;- hfi_new_2 %&gt;% \nfilter (region == \"Eastern Europe\")\n\n\nNote - As expected, the new data frame has only 198 cases (rows). - The number of columns (variables) stays the same as in hfi_new2.\nIf you wanted countries from Eastern Europe OR from Western Europe. To do this, you separate the regions using a | as shown below:\n\nCodehfi_new_4 &lt;- hfi_new_2 %&gt;% \nfilter (region == \"Eastern Europe\"| region== \"Western Europe\")\n\n\n\nGroup_by is a special kind of filtering that is commonly used alongside a summarize function. Suppose you want to compute the average freedom score (pf_score) by region. You can achieve this by piping the data into a group_by function that will group the data according to your wish and then call the summarize function. Run the code below:\n\nCodehfi_new_4 %&gt;% \n  group_by (region) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean(pf_score))\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the code did not return a value for Eastern Europe. This is because there are some missing values in the data for Eastern Europe. To fix this, you can add one more step in the workflow that will drop the NA values from the pf_score variable. See below:\n\nCodehfi_new_4 %&gt;%\n  drop_na(pf_score)%&gt;% # This is the new step\n  group_by (region) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean(pf_score))",

    "text": "As can be seen from the hfi documentation (obtained by running ?hfi in the console), the variable pf_score measures the personal freedom score of a country. The higher the score a country has on pf_score, the more the personal freedoms enjoyed by its people. On the other hand, the variable pf_expression_control measures the extent to which countries place political pressure and controls on the media content. A low score on pf_expression_control means higher controls and political pressure.\nWhat is the relationship between personal freedom score (pf_score) and the personal freedom expression control (pf_expression_contro l) for Western and Eastern European countries?

    "text": "Part 1\nInflation across the world\nFor this part of the analysis you will work with inflation data from various countries in the world over the last 30 years.\n\ncountry_inflation &lt;- read_csv(\"data/country-inflation.csv\")\n\nQuestion 1\nGet to know the data.\n\nglimpse() at the country_inflation data frame and answer the following questions based on the output. How many rows does country_inflation have and what does each row represent? How many columns does country_inflation have and what does each column represent?\nDisplay a list of the countries included in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA function that can be useful for part (b) is pull(). Check out its documentation for examples of usage.\n\n\nQuestion 2\nWhich countries had the top three highest inflation rates in 2021? Your output should be a data frame with two columns, country and 2021, with inflation rates in descending order, and three rows for the top three countries. Briefly comment on how the inflation rates for these countries compare to the inflation rate for United States in that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nColumn names that are numbers are not considered “proper” in R, therefore to select them you’ll need to surround them with backticks, e.g. select( ` 1993 ` ).\n\n\nQuestion 3\nIn a single pipeline,\n\ncalculate the ratio of the inflation in 2021 and inflation in 1993 for each country and store this information in a new column called inf_ratio,\narrange the data frame in decreasing order of inf_ratio, and\nselect the variables country and inf_ratio to display as the result of the pipeline.\n\nDo not save this new variable in inf_ratio, only calculate and display it so you can answer the following question based on the output of the pipeline.\nWhich country’s inflation change is the largest over this time period? Did inflation increase of decrease between 1993 and 2021 in this country?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor this question you’ll once again need to use variables whose names are numbers (years) in your pipeline. Make sure to surround the names of such variables with backticks (`).\n\n\nQuestion 4\nReshape (pivot) country_inflation such that each row represents a country/year combination, with columns country, year, and annual_inflation. Then, display the resulting data frame and state how many rows and columns it has.\nRequirements:\n\nYour code must use one of pivot_longer() or pivot_wider(). There are other ways you can do this reshaping move in R, but this question requires solving this problem by pivoting.\nIn your pivot_*() function, you must use names_transform = as.numeric as an argument to transform the variable type to numeric as you pivot the data so that in the resulting data frame the year variable is numeric.\nThe resulting data frame must be saved as something other than country_inflation so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite country_inflation. Use a short but informative name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe remaining questions in Part 1 require the use of the pivoted data frame from Question 4.\n\n\nQuestion 5\nUse a separate, single pipeline to answer each of the following questions.\nRequirement: Your code must use the filter() function for each part, not arrange().\n\nWhat is the highest inflation rate observed between 1993 and 2021? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with one row and three columns. In addition to code and output, your response should include a single sentence stating the country and year.\nWhat is the lowest inflation rate observed between 1993 and 2021? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with one row and three columns. In addition to code and output, your response should include a single sentence stating the country and year.\nPutting (a) and (b) together: What are the highest and the lowest inflation rates observed between 1993 and 2021? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with two rows and three columns.\nQuestion 6\na. Create a vector called countries_of_interest which contains the names of up tp five countries you want to visualize the inflation rates for over the years. For example, if these countries are Türkiye and United States, you can express this as follows:\n\ncountries_of_interest &lt;- c(\"Türkiye\", \"United States\")\n\nIf they are Türkiye, United States, and China, you can express this as follows:\n\ncountries_of_interest &lt;- c(\n  \"Türkiye\", \"United States\", \"China (People's Republic of)\"\n)\n\nSo on and so forth… Then, in 1-2 sentences, state why you chose these countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYour countries_of_interest should consist of no more than five countries. Make sure that the spelling of your countries matches how they appear in the dataset.\n\n\nb. In a single pipeline, filter your reshaped dataset to include only the countries_of_interest from part (a), and save the resulting data frame with a new name so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite the data frame you’re starting with. Use a short but informative name. Then, in a new pipeline, find the distinct() countries in the data frame you created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe number of distinct countries in the filtered data frame you created in part (b) should equal the number of countries you chose in part (a). If it doesn’t, you might have misspelled a country name or made a mistake in how to filter for these countries. Go back and check your code.\n\n\nQuestion 7\nUsing your data frame from the previous question, create a plot of annual inflation vs. year for these countries. Then, in a few sentences, describe the patterns you observe in the plot, particularly focusing on anything you find surprising or not surprising, based on your knowledge (or lack thereof) of these countries economies.\nRequirements for the plot:\n\nData should be represented with points as well as lines connecting the points for each country.\nEach country should be represented by a different color line and different color and shape points.\nAxes and legend should be properly labeled.\nThe plot should have an appropriate title (and optionally a subtitle).\nPlot should be customized in at least one way – you could use a different than default color scale, or different than default theme, or some other customization.\n\n\nIf you haven’t yet done so, now is a good time to render, commit, and push. Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding."

    "title": "Hello, World!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It is possible that some of you have heard/seen the phrase, Hello, World!, before. That is usually the first thing you learn in programming, i.e., to learn to write a computer program to print this sentence to screen. In this lab, we will not print Hello, World! to the screen. Instead, we will learn how to use R (via RStudio) to perform statistical analyses and to write reports in order to communicate the insights learned from data. While the analysis involves writing computer code, it is in no way going to involve writing computer programs. The goal of today’s lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio. You will learn to access and use RStudio, as well as perform the basic functions regarding statistical analysis. To clarify which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface (Integrated Development Environment or IDE) for working with R. I like to think about R as the car engine and RStudio as a nice driver dashboard. The engine drives the car, but the dashboard makes it easier for the driver to control the car. Most R users work with RStudio.\n\n\nCar Engine and Dashboard\n\nWe will work with the cloud (online) version of RStudio. To access RStudio online, click on the link https://posit.cloud to create an account or to sign in if you already have an account.\n\nAfter signing in to R studio, our next step is to create a new project. You can think of a project as a folder or simply a collection of files. Our project will be called “MATH 246 Fall 2024”. Each lab that you complete will be saved in this project. To create the project, you start by clicking on “New Project” and then change the default name (UNTITLED PROJECT) to “MATH 246 Fall 2024”.\nYay! You now have your project ready. In the next section, we explain the meaning of the various panels on your screen.\n\nYour new R studio project interface will look as follows:\n\n\n\nLeft Panel: The panel on the left is where the action happens. This panel is called the console. Every time you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you’re running. Below that information is the symbol ” &gt; “. This is where you enter your commands. When you enter and execute a command, the output will come right below it. These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data, organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations. Try typing 1 + 1 in the console and hit enter.\n\nCode1+1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nUpper Right Panel: The panel in the upper right is called “environment”. It contains, among other things, the history of the actions or commands that you’ve previously entered.\nBottom Right Panel: The panel in the lower right contains tabs for browsing the files in your project folder, access help files for R functions, install and manage R packages, and inspecting visualizations through the viewer tab. By default, all data visualizations you make will appear directly below the code you used to create them. If you would rather your plots appear in the plots tab, you will need to change your global options.\n\nR is an open-source programming language, meaning that users can contribute packages that make our lives easier, and we can use them for free. Packages are simply pre-written code meant to serve specific purposes and may contain other packages inside them. Packages may also contain data sets. Packages are stored in a directory called “Library”. For this lab, and many others in the future, we will use the following two packages:\n\nThe tidyverse package is a very popular “umbrella” package which houses a suite of many different R packages: for data wrangling (including tidying) and data visualization.\nThe openintro package for data and custom functions with the OpenIntro resources. You will notice that the readings frequently refer to data contained in the OpenIntro Package. This is the package.\n\n\nThe command to install a package in R takes the following format:\ninstall.packages(\"package name\")\nTo install tidyverse and openintro, run the following commands:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"openintro\")\nNote: You only need to install packages once, but you need to load them each time you relaunch RStudio. To call load (activate) the above installed packages, you use the following command:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(openintro)\nWhy Tidyverse? We are choosing to use the tidyverse package collection because it consists of a set of packages necessary for different aspects of working with data, anything from loading data to wrangling data to visualizing data to analyzing data. Additionally, these packages share common philosophies and are designed to work together. You can find more about the packages in the tidyverse at tidyverse.org.\n\nSuppose we want to find the mean of the numbers 23,24,26,19,18,25,21, and 39. The first thing you want to do is to get these data into R. We can achieve this by running the code below:\n\nCodex &lt;- c(23,24,26,19,18,25,21, 39) \n# We use the symbol &lt;- for assigning elements to an object. \n\n\nHere, we are creating a vector (a series of numbers) and storing it in an object called x. The symbols &lt;- is used for assignment. In R, we use a # to designate a comment (text that should not be evaluated as code). In above chunk, the text after # is a comment. Comments are a good way to document your code.\nTo find the mean of those numbers, we simply run the command mean(x) as shown below.\n\nCodemean(x)\n\n[1] 24.375\n\n\nThe general format is do_this(on_this). Here, do_this is the function while x is the thing on which we want an action taken.\nTo find the median of the numbers, we run the command median(x) as shown below.\n\nCodemedian(x)\n\n[1] 23.5\n\n\nWe can also create a string object (i.e., a series of non-numerical elements or characters). We use quotes for string characters. See below:\n\nCodey &lt;- c( \"Jane\", \"John\", \"Jess\", \"Jeff\", \"Joe\", \"Holli\", \"Henry\", \"Han\") \n# We use quotes for strings.\n\n\nNow, try to run the command mean(y):\n\nCodemean(y)\n\nWarning in mean.default(y): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nWhat do you get? Programming languages generally produce error messages when you try to perform an inappropriate operation or if there is a mistake in the code. Error messages are a good way to learn what you did wrong. In this case, the mean/average of the object y does not make sense because the entries of y are not numerical.\nYou can, however, perform other operations on y. For example, you may want to know how many Jane entries are in y. To do this, you may simply tabulate the entries in y as shown below:\n\nCodetable(y)\n\ny\n  Han Henry Holli  Jane  Jeff  Jess   Joe  John \n    1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1 \n\n\nWe see that there is only one Jane entry in y. While you could easily count the number of Jane entries in y, the table function is useful when you have many entries and you want to know how many times each entry appears.\nBefore we proceed, delete (or comment out) the mean(y) that you had written earlier.\n\nYou can create a data frame by combining vectors of equal length. Before we do that, let us create two more vectors (a numeric one and a character one).\n\nCodea&lt;-c(3,3,2,2,3,4,1,2)\n\nb&lt;-c(\"F\", \"M\", \"F\", \"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"M\", \"M\")\n\n\nYou can combine the vectors a, b, c, x, and y into a data frame as follows. We store this in an object called practice_data and then print it. Note that we use an underscore to separate the words practice and data in the name. Do not use a blank space for object or variable names.\n\nCodepractice_data &lt;- data.frame(name=y, age=x, sex=b, year=a)\nprint (practice_data)\n\n   name age sex year\n1  Jane  23   F    3\n2  John  24   M    3\n3  Jess  26   F    2\n4  Jeff  19   M    2\n5   Joe  18   M    3\n6 Holli  25   F    4\n7 Henry  21   M    1\n8   Han  39   M    2\n\n\nNotice that the data frame looks like a more natural way that you are likely to encounter data. Most of the time, data is collected and stored in excel and can be imported into R for use. Throughout the labs, we will learn how to import data from various sources into R.\n\nWe can run various statistics from data frames. Because the data frame combines many vectors (variables) we need to specify the data frame name and the variable we are targeting. For example, to find the mean of age, we write the data frame name and variable name separated by a dollar sign as follows mean(practice_data$age).\n\nCodemean(practice_data$age)\n\n[1] 24.375\n\n\nYou can also find other statistics. For median, the command is median(data$variable). For standard deviation, the command is sd(data$variable).\nYou can also run multiple summary statistics at once using the command summary(median(data$variable)). See below:\n\nCodesummary(practice_data$age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  18.00   20.50   23.50   24.38   25.25   39.00 \n\n\nThe summary command give you the minimum value, first quartile, median, mean, third quartile and maximum value.\n\nYou can create basic plots in base R:\n\nTo create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between age and year, you can use the code below:\n\nCodeplot(practice_data$age, practice_data$year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a bar plot to visualize the distribution of M and F, you can use the command below:\n\nCodebarplot(table((practice_data$sex)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an object (name it income) containing the following numerical elements: 750, 810, 680, 1200, 1500, 1399,1525.\nFind the mean of the values in #1 above.\nCreate another object with names of your choosing and then combine it with the first object to make a data frame called my_data.\nRun the summary statistics for the income variable using my_data data frame that you created in #3 above.\nR comes with many pre-loaded data frames. One such data frame is called mtcars. Run the command ?mtcars to learn more about this data frame. Next, load this data frame into your work space by running the command data(mtcars).\nUse the mtcars data frame to find the median horsepower of the cars.\nCreate a histogram to visualize the distribution of the variable hp.

    "text": "Suppose we want to find the mean of the numbers 23,24,26,19,18,25,21, and 39. The first thing you want to do is to get these data into R. We can achieve this by running the code below:\n\nCodex &lt;- c(23,24,26,19,18,25,21, 39) \n# We use the symbol &lt;- for assigning elements to an object. \n\n\nHere, we are creating a vector (a series of numbers) and storing it in an object called x. The symbols &lt;- is used for assignment. In R, we use a # to designate a comment (text that should not be evaluated as code). In above chunk, the text after # is a comment. Comments are a good way to document your code.\nTo find the mean of those numbers, we simply run the command mean(x) as shown below.\n\nCodemean(x)\n\n[1] 24.375\n\n\nThe general format is do_this(on_this). Here, do_this is the function while x is the thing on which we want an action taken.\nTo find the median of the numbers, we run the command median(x) as shown below.\n\nCodemedian(x)\n\n[1] 23.5\n\n\nWe can also create a string object (i.e., a series of non-numerical elements or characters). We use quotes for string characters. See below:\n\nCodey &lt;- c( \"Jane\", \"John\", \"Jess\", \"Jeff\", \"Joe\", \"Holli\", \"Henry\", \"Han\") \n# We use quotes for strings.\n\n\nNow, try to run the command mean(y):\n\nCodemean(y)\n\nWarning in mean.default(y): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nWhat do you get? Programming languages generally produce error messages when you try to perform an inappropriate operation or if there is a mistake in the code. Error messages are a good way to learn what you did wrong. In this case, the mean/average of the object y does not make sense because the entries of y are not numerical.\nYou can, however, perform other operations on y. For example, you may want to know how many Jane entries are in y. To do this, you may simply tabulate the entries in y as shown below:\n\nCodetable(y)\n\ny\n  Han Henry Holli  Jane  Jeff  Jess   Joe  John \n    1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1 \n\n\nWe see that there is only one Jane entry in y. While you could easily count the number of Jane entries in y, the table function is useful when you have many entries and you want to know how many times each entry appears.\nBefore we proceed, delete (or comment out) the mean(y) that you had written earlier.",

    "text": "In today’s lab, we introduce an interface known as quarto that is helpful in creating reproducible reports. One of the most powerful features of quarto is the fact that you can write code (in code chunks) and plain text in the same document. You can generate (render) your work into formats such as pdf, word, html, etc that can be shared easily. If you are using the desktop version of quarto, you need to download quarto from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ before you proceed.\n\nWe are going to need a package called palmerpenguins. Install it before you proceed. To install the package, run the following command in the console\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins)\nAn alternative way to install a package in RStudio is to use the install button in the packages tab.\n\nTo create your First Quarto file, follow the following steps:\nGo to File&gt;New File &gt; Quarto document. See below:\n\nAfter clicking Quarto document,a pop up window will appear with fields for the title and author. Enter the title of the document as Introducing Quarto and Tidyverse because that is what we are doing today. Write your name under author. The output format can stay as HTML. You can always change these options even after creating the document. The popup window looks as follows:\n\nClick create to create the document. Note that the document appears with the name Untitled. Click on file then navigate to save then change the name from untitled to Lab_01. Remember, we do not want to use a space for the document name. To tell whether your document saved properly, you will see the document under files with a .qmd extension. With this document saved here, you can always return to it any time and continue working.\nNow, click on Render to see the output of the document you just created. You will note that the document has both plain text and code chunks. We shall use the code chunks for writing code and plain text for interpreting our analyses and writing reports. To add your own code chunk, just click on code the go to add new chunk or use the keyboard shortcut cmd+opt+I on a mac and control+opt+I on windows. When doing this, make sure your cursor is at the place where you want to create the new code chunk.\nBy default, the code chunk that comes is for R code. If you want to write python code, just change the r to python.\nTo create a new code chunk, you can copy an already existing code chunk and paste it elsewhere on the document then edit it appropriately. You may also create new code chunks by clicking on Code and navigating to Insert code chunk.\n\nIn a code chunk, you write code that you want to reproduce in your report. There are other operations such as installing packages that should be done only in the console. When you render a quarto document, quarto runs all code chunks sequentially from top to bottom in order to output your report (in pdf, html, or word). If any code chunks has code for package installation, it means R will try to re-install the package every time you render the document (we said packages are installed one). Operations such as activating packages, i.e., library(package name), should be included in the first code chunk.\nAs a start, let us load the openintro, tidyverse, and palmerpenguins packages. Copy and paste the following code in the first code chunk:\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nRun the code chunk with the packages to ensure that they are all working. If any of them is missing, R will prompt you to install them.\n\nRemember that the openintro package contains the data that comes with the openintro text. To view a complete list of the data frames, visit https://www.openintro.org/data/. Today, we will use a data frame called penguins contained in the palmerpenguins package. To learn more about this data frame, run the following code in the console:\n?penguins\nTo load the data into your document, run the following command:\n\nCodedata(\"penguins\")\n\n\nWhen you run the above code, a new object should appear in the environment area. Click on penguins to view and study the data.\n\nNow that you have “imported” the data into R, we want to perform a few analyses. We are going to use the tidyverse package to do this. The tidyverse is a collection of R packages for data analysis that are developed with common ideas and norms. According to @Wickham2019,\n“At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next.”\n\nIn lab_00, we performed the analyses using base R code. We saw that to compute the mean of a given variable in a data frame, you use data_frame_name$variable_name. The tidyverse workflow is a bit different and is what we shall use for the most part.\nFor example, to compute the mean of bill_length_mm from the penguins data frame, base R code would be\nmean(penguins$bill_length_mm)\nTry the code to see if it works. If not, what is the problem and how would you fix it?\nIn the tidyverse, the code for the mean of the bill length would be\npenguins %&gt;% summarize(length_mean = mean(bill_length_mm))\nThe symbol %&gt;% is called a pipe and is very common in tidyverse. It takes anything on its left and sends it (pipes it) to the function on the right. Here, we are taking the mtcars data frame and piping it into the summarize function (the function for summary statistics). Inside the function, we specify the variable and the statistic (in this case the mean). We have chosen to name the result as length_mean but this could be changed.\nYou can compute other summary statistics in a similar manner as above and if there is an NA one way to deal with would be to remove it. In some cases, one would replace NA with the average of the other values.\n\nIn this section, we will start by creating scatter plots and then proceed to bar plots. You will learn about more visualization tools in later labs.\n\nSuppose we want to answer the following question: Do penguins with longer flippers weigh more or less than penguins with shorter flippers?\nWe will use a package called ggplot2 (part of tidyverse) to create a scatter plot to visualize the association between flipper length and and body weight.\nggplot2 is a package (part of the tidyverse umbrella) that is used to create nice-looking graphics. It adopts the grammar of graphics, which is a coherent system for describing and building graphs.\nYou provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.\nWith ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function ggplot(), defining a plot object that you then add layers to sequentially until you get the desired plot. We will do this in steps:\n\nStep 1: Add the data:\n\n\nCode  ggplot(data = penguins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates an empty canvas\n\nStep 2: Provide the information about the x-axis and the y-axis (i.e., what variable do you want where?). We call this a mapping.\n\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above code adds to our empty canvas the variables specified for the y axis and the x-axis. We still do not have a scatter plot.\n\nStep 3: Define the geometry (geom) that you want ggplot2 to use. In our case, we want to use points and so we use the function geom_point(). Notice that you must have the parentheses because this is a function that can take arguments (you will learn more about this). Use teh code below:\n\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe finally have our scatter plot. Based on this scatter plot, what can you say about the question we sought to answer?\nRemember the steps:\n\nGive ggplot the data,\nprovide a mapping, and\ndefine a geometry using geom_.\n\nQuestion: Try to change the geometry above to a histogram, i.e.,\nggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_histogram()\nDoes it work? If not, why?\n\nThe scatter plot above is a great tool to visualize the relationship between the two variables (flipper length and weight). Suppose we want to add a third (categorical) variable such as species to the scatter plot. We can achieve this by adding a third argument such as color to the aesthetics). See code below:\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color=species )\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn from this new scatter plot that you do not from the first?\nYou can also visualize how the different species are scattered on the same scale by using the face_wrap function. See code below\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~species)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also add a numerical variable such as bill_depth_mm. See code below:\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color=bill_depth_mm )\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn from this scatter plot that you do not from the first?\n\nYou can also create bar plots in a similar manner as above. Remember that bar plots are for categorical variables. For example, we can use a bar plot to visualize the species of the penguins. See code below:\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above bar plot simply gives us the count for each species. If you wanted to color the bars by species, you can\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, color=species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can make the colors to fill the bars by using fill instead of color. See below:\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill=species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to add another categorical variable such as island to visualize the relationship, you can fill by island nstead of by species. See below:\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with this bar plot is that it is difficult to interpret. We often prefer to have side-by-side bar plots. To achieve this, we add an argument called position inside the geom_bar function and set it to dodge.\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2 pts) There is a data frame called loan50 that is contained in the openintro package. load the data frame into your work space. \n\n\n(2 pts) Give a brief description of this data frame. How many variables does the data frame have? How many cases/observations does it have? \n\n\n(4 pts) Do people that have been employed for long tend to get lower interest rates? To answer this question, create a scatter plot for the variables emp_length and interest_rate. \n\n\n(4 pts) Recreate the following plot using the loan50 data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4 pts) Create a bar plot (with differently colored bars) to visualize the distribution of the loans by homeownership.

    "text": "Now that you have “imported” the data into R, we want to perform a few analyses. We are going to use the tidyverse package to do this. The tidyverse is a collection of R packages for data analysis that are developed with common ideas and norms. According to @Wickham2019,\n“At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next.”\n\nIn lab_00, we performed the analyses using base R code. We saw that to compute the mean of a given variable in a data frame, you use data_frame_name$variable_name. The tidyverse workflow is a bit different and is what we shall use for the most part.\nFor example, to compute the mean of bill_length_mm from the penguins data frame, base R code would be\nmean(penguins$bill_length_mm)\nTry the code to see if it works. If not, what is the problem and how would you fix it?\nIn the tidyverse, the code for the mean of the bill length would be\npenguins %&gt;% summarize(length_mean = mean(bill_length_mm))\nThe symbol %&gt;% is called a pipe and is very common in tidyverse. It takes anything on its left and sends it (pipes it) to the function on the right. Here, we are taking the mtcars data frame and piping it into the summarize function (the function for summary statistics). Inside the function, we specify the variable and the statistic (in this case the mean). We have chosen to name the result as length_mean but this could be changed.\nYou can compute other summary statistics in a similar manner as above and if there is an NA one way to deal with would be to remove it. In some cases, one would replace NA with the average of the other values.",

    "text": "In this section, we will start by creating scatter plots and then proceed to bar plots. You will learn about more visualization tools in later labs.\n\nSuppose we want to answer the following question: Do penguins with longer flippers weigh more or less than penguins with shorter flippers?\nWe will use a package called ggplot2 (part of tidyverse) to create a scatter plot to visualize the association between flipper length and and body weight.\nggplot2 is a package (part of the tidyverse umbrella) that is used to create nice-looking graphics. It adopts the grammar of graphics, which is a coherent system for describing and building graphs.\nYou provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.\nWith ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function ggplot(), defining a plot object that you then add layers to sequentially until you get the desired plot. We will do this in steps:\n\nStep 1: Add the data:\n\n\nCode  ggplot(data = penguins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates an empty canvas\n\nStep 2: Provide the information about the x-axis and the y-axis (i.e., what variable do you want where?). We call this a mapping.\n\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above code adds to our empty canvas the variables specified for the y axis and the x-axis. We still do not have a scatter plot.\n\nStep 3: Define the geometry (geom) that you want ggplot2 to use. In our case, we want to use points and so we use the function geom_point(). Notice that you must have the parentheses because this is a function that can take arguments (you will learn more about this). Use teh code below:\n\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe finally have our scatter plot. Based on this scatter plot, what can you say about the question we sought to answer?\nRemember the steps:\n\nGive ggplot the data,\nprovide a mapping, and\ndefine a geometry using geom_.\n\nQuestion: Try to change the geometry above to a histogram, i.e.,\nggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_histogram()\nDoes it work? If not, why?\n\nThe scatter plot above is a great tool to visualize the relationship between the two variables (flipper length and weight). Suppose we want to add a third (categorical) variable such as species to the scatter plot. We can achieve this by adding a third argument such as color to the aesthetics). See code below:\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color=species )\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn from this new scatter plot that you do not from the first?\nYou can also visualize how the different species are scattered on the same scale by using the face_wrap function. See code below\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~species)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also add a numerical variable such as bill_depth_mm. See code below:\n\nCodeggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color=bill_depth_mm )\n) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you learn from this scatter plot that you do not from the first?\n\nYou can also create bar plots in a similar manner as above. Remember that bar plots are for categorical variables. For example, we can use a bar plot to visualize the species of the penguins. See code below:\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above bar plot simply gives us the count for each species. If you wanted to color the bars by species, you can\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, color=species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can make the colors to fill the bars by using fill instead of color. See below:\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill=species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to add another categorical variable such as island to visualize the relationship, you can fill by island nstead of by species. See below:\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with this bar plot is that it is difficult to interpret. We often prefer to have side-by-side bar plots. To achieve this, we add an argument called position inside the geom_bar function and set it to dodge.\n\nCodeggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")",

Calculate the \\(R^2\\) for this model, and interpret it in context.\n\nFirst, we calculate the SST: \\(SST = \\sum(y_i-\\bar{y})^2 = (10-14.33)^2+...+ (18-14.33)^2 \\approx 68\\).\nNext, we calculate the SSE: \\(SSE = \\sum(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 = (10-10.41)^2+...+ 0.2518-18.25^2 \\approx 9.98\\).  Note that \\(\\hat{y}_1=10.41=5.51+0.98\\times 5\\)\nFinally, we calculate the \\(R^2\\): \\(R^2 = 1 - \\frac{9.98}{68} = 0.8532\\).\n\nInterpretation: 85.32% of the variation in the total length of the fish (response variable) is explained by the head length (predictor variable). This is a strong fit.\nNotice that the square root of \\(R^2\\) is approximately equal to the correlation coefficient \\(r\\). For SLR, \\[R^2 \\approx r^2\\]."

    "text": "Outliers in Linear Regression\n\nOutliers in regression are observations that tend to fall far from the cloud of points in a scatterplot.\nOutlying can happen in the x-direction, y-direction, or both.\nOutliers that fall horizontally away from the center of the cloud of points are called leverage points.\n\nOutlying point(s) may or may not have an impact on the regression line. Whenever the points influence the slope of the line, they are called influential points (see next slide).\nIt can be very tempting to remove outliers from the data. However, this should be done with caution. Models that ignore exceptional points often perform poorly.\nOne way to deal with outliers is to perform two separate analyses - one with the outliers and one without. This will give a more holistic picture."

To check this, you can use a scatterplot.\nIndependence: The observations/cases are independent of each other. This is often a matter of study design.\nNormality: The residuals are normally distributed. This can be checked using a histogram of the residuals.\nEqual variance: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the predictor variable. This is also called homoscedasticity.

After choosing the data frame, your will need to brainstorm on several issues about the data such as the sample and sampling methods that might have been used to gather the data, a possible target population, variables and their types (numerical vs categorical), among others. Your team will then come up with a research topic/goal and two research questions (directly related to the topic) that you will answer by conducting the analyses. Your analyses should include data visualizations, numerical statistics, and regression models. All these must be appropriately linked to help tell a coherent story."

It must contain the following details:\n\nTeam members and their roles: List the names of all team members and their roles in the project. Roles can include Data cleaning/wrangling, Data analysis (performing the analyses in RStudio), Writing (e.g., abstract, intro, literature review, findings, conclusion), Proof reading and typo fixing, Team leader (e.g., setting up meetings, follow up, communicate with professor), etc.\nResearch topic and Questions: As indicated earlier, this is a short statement that describes the general area of interest that your research questions will be addressing. You should have at least two research questions that you will answer by conducting the analyses.\nData: Describe the data you will be using. This should include the source of the data, the number of observations and variables, and a brief description of the variables and their types (e.g., numerical, categorical). You should also include a brief description of the data collection process. Note that the data collection process may not be available for all data sets. In this case, you are allowed to speculate (reasonably) on the data collection process and be sure to mention that in your proposal.\nAnalysis plan: Describe the analyses you plan to conduct. This should include the types of visualizations you plan to create, the numerical summaries you plan to calculate, and the regression models you plan to fit.

It should also provide a brief overview of the results you have obtained. Think of the abstract as an executive summary of your work that someone can read and understand without reading the rest of the report. You should write the abstract last, after you have completed the rest of the report.\nIntroduction: This section should introduce the research topic and questions you are addressing. It should also provide a brief overview of the data you are using and the analyses you plan to conduct. Cite a few sources that are relevant to your research topic.\nLiterature Review: This section should provide a brief overview of the literature related to your research topic. You should cite at least 5 sources and synthesize their methods and findings in relation to your own research. Guidelines for writing an effective literature review can be found here.\nMethods: This section should describe the data you are using and the analyses you plan to conduct. It should include the following subsections:\n\nData Description: This section should describe the data you are using. This should include the source of the data, the number of observations and variables, and a brief description of the variables and their types (e.g., numerical, categorical).

In this case, you are allowed to speculate (reasonably) on the data collection process and be sure to mention that in your proposal.\nResearch Questions and Analyses: This section should list the research questions you are addressing. You should also describe the variables of interest in your data set that will help you answer these questions. Discuus the methids you plan to use for each question and why you think they are appropriate.\nData Cleaning: This section should describe the steps you took to clean the data. This may include removing missing values, transforming variables, etc. Depending on your data set, you may not need to do much data cleaning. If this is the case, you should still describe the steps you took to clean the data, even if they are minimal.\n\nData Analysis and Results: This is one of the most important heavily weighted parts of your project. The analyses should be sound and justified appropriately (under methods). Here, you just need to implement the analyses described under the methodology section of your paper. Your analyses should demonstrate a thorough understanding of statistical concepts learned in this course (and beyond, if you like). Your data analyses must include both numerical statistics and data visualizations. You must also use regression modelling (linear or logistic) techniques as part of your analyses. Interpretations of visualizations created as well as the models created must be made in a coherent manner and in the context of the research questions. These are the results/findings of your project.\nConclusion: This section should summarize the research questions you addressed, the data you used, the analyses you conducted, and the results you obtained. Findings of your study must be tied back to those reported in the literature review; for example, do your findings concur with previous studies or do they contradict them? It should also discuss the implications of your results and suggest directions for future research. Be sure to state any limitations of your study and what would be done differently if you were to do the study again.\nReferences: This section should list all the sources you cited in your report. Use APA format for your references.\n\nInstructions and grading criteria for this milestone are outlined in Milestone 2: Proposal."

    "text": "Due to COVID-19 pandemic, many states made alternatives in voting, such as voting by mail, more widely available for the 2020 U.S. election. The general consensus was that voters who were more Democratic leaning would be more likely to vote by mail, while more Republican leaning voters would largely vote in-person. This was supported by multiple surveys, including this survey conducted by Pew Research.\nThe goal of this analysis is to use regression analysis to explore the relationship between a county’s political leanings and the proportion of votes cast in-person in 2020. The ultimate question we want to answer is Did counties with more Republican leanings have a larger proportion of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election?\nWe will use the proportion of votes cast for Donald Trump in 2016 (pctTrump_2016) as a measure of a county’s political leaning. Counties with a higher proportion of votes for Trump in 2016 are considered to have more Republican leanings.\nWe will focus on the following variables for this analysis:",
