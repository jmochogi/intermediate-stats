Below are some support services available to you.

## Open Hours

<!--This is how you do an internal linking: You can find a list of everyone's office hours [here](/course-team.html).-->

I will be available during open hours (Mon 12.00 - 01.00 pm) to answer questions or concerns that you may have in the course.
You can simply walk in during the stated time above.
Even if you don't have any question, you can just stop by to say hi.

The mathematics department is committed to the success of all students enrolled in mathematics courses.
Free one-on-one support for your mathematics coursework is available during select daytime and evening hours Monday-Friday at the Mathematics Room (Williams Hall 209).
The Mathematics Room is staffed by mathematics faculty and vetted students.
Student tutors offer support to fellow students in courses numbered 200 and below while math faculty offer support in any of the math courses.
For more information and the schedule, please visit the [Math Support Center](https://www.ithaca.edu/academics/school-humanities-and-sciences/mathematics/courses-placement-resources/mathematics-support-center).

## Discussion Forums

Have a question that can’t wait for office hours?
Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person?
The Canvas Discussion forums, might be the best venue for these!
There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on before asking a new question.
If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!
In Canvas discussion section, anybody is able to start threads and others can jump in with replies.

## Email

Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go to Canvas Discussion forums), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.).
My email address is [jgeteregechi\@ithaca.edu](mailto:jgeteregechi@ithaca.edu).

If there is a question that's not appropriate for the public forum, you are welcome to email me directly.
**If you email me, please include "MATH 246" in the subject line.** Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to MATH 246 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday.
Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.
If I take too long, please reach out again or talk to me before or after class as I may have missed your email.

## Tutoring and Academic Enrichment Services

## Mental health and wellness

If your mental health concerns and/or stressful events negatively affect your daily emotional state, academic performance, or ability to participate in your daily activities, many resources are available to help you through difficult times.
Please visit the [Mental Health Services](https://www.ithaca.edu/student-health-services/health-services/mental-health-services) for more information.
Ithaca College encourages all students to access these resources.

## Course costs

-   **Textbooks:** The textbooks for this course are open-source and freely available on the web.

-   **Laptops:** Each student is expected to have a laptop they can bring to each lecture and lab.

-   **Software subscriptions:**

    -   **RStudio:** RStudio cloud ([posit cloud](https://posit.cloud/)) is available for a \$5 per month subscription for students. I may be able to have funds to sign up about 16 students this semester. The criteria is to have at least two group members with a full licence for the semester. Although the software has a free version, it allows only 25 hours of use per month. The positive side is that it does come with all the functionality that we will need for the course.
    -   **GitHub:** You will need to sign up for a free [GitHub](https://education.github.com/) account. We will not use GitHub as much but you will need to sign up for a student developer pack to get access to GitHub copilot for free as a student. Be sure to use your Ithaca College email while signing up.
    -   **GitHub Copilot:** GitHub Copilot is free for students. You will need to sign up for the student developer pack before you sign up for a free GitHub copilot account.

    The detailed instructions for signing up for GitHub copilot are available on [this site](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/step-by-step-setting-up-github-student-and-github-copilot-as-an/ba-p/3736279)
