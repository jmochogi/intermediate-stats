The general consensus was that voters who were more Democratic leaning would be more likely to vote by mail, while more Republican leaning voters would largely vote in-person. This was supported by multiple surveys, including [this survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/09/08/americans-expectations-about-voting-in-2020-presidential-election-are-colored-by-partisan-differences/) conducted by Pew Research.\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to use regression analysis to explore the relationship between a county’s political leanings and the proportion of votes cast in-person in 2020. The ultimate question we want to answer is **Did counties with more Republican leanings have a larger proportion of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election?**\n\nWe will use the proportion of votes cast for Donald Trump in 2016 (pctTrump_2016) as a measure of a county’s political leaning. Counties with a higher proportion of votes for Trump in 2016 are considered to have more Republican leanings.\n\nWe will focus on the following variables for this analysis:\n\n-   **`inperson_pct`**: The proportion of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election in a given county.\n\n-   **`pctTrump_2016`**: The proportion of a given county's votes cast for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n## Importing the Data\n\nUp to this point in this course we have been using data frames that we either created in R or loaded from some package. In this problem set, you will import a dataset in csv format into your RStudio cloud and into your quarto work space before you proceed. The data set is available on [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sL4UfIjimVcmSt46iAjfHTjkX477yBEp/view?usp=sharing.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--If you data loads properly, it is highly recommended that you take some time to study it so you understand its context and variables. Doing this will make your analyses easier and interpretations will be meaningful.-->\n\n## Problem 1 (data visualization & summary stats)\n\na)  Create a visualization for the variable `inperson_pct` and calculate at least two summary statistics to measure the central tendency, as well as one summary statistic to measure the spread. Then, interpret both the visualization and the summary statistics in context of the data.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    ggplot(data=nc_election, aes(x=inperson_pct)) +\n      geom_histogram(binwidth=0.05, fill=\"lightblue\", color=\"black\") +\n      labs(title=\"Distribution of in-person votes in 2020\",\n           x=\"Proportion of in-person votes\",\n           y=\"Frequency\") +\n      theme_minimal()\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](ps-2_solution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    nc_election|> \n      summarize(median(inperson_pct))\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n      median(inperson_pct)\n    1            0.5997411\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    nc_election|> \n      summarize(sd(inperson_pct))\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n      sd(inperson_pct)\n    1        0.1274333\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    *The histogram shows that the distribution of the proportion of in-person votes is nearly normal with a slight left skew and a median at around 60%. There are no noticeable outliers in the plot.*\n\nb)  Create a visualization of the relationship between `inperson_pct` and `pctTrump_2016`. Draw the least squares regression line along the cloud of points. Based on the visualization, how would you describe the relationship?\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    ggplot(data=nc_election, aes(x=pctTrump_2016, y=inperson_pct)) +\n      geom_point(color=\"darkblue\") +\n      labs(title=\"Trump Votes 2016 vs In-person votes in 2020\",\n           x=\"Proportion of Trump Votes in 2016\",\n           y=\"Proportion of in-person Votes\") +\n      theme_minimal()+\n      geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=F)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](ps-2_solution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    *The plot shows a weak but positive linear relationship between the proportion of in-person votes and proportion of votes cast for Trump in 2016. Counties that had higher rates of votes cast for Trump in 2016 appear to have higher rates of in-person votes. The two counties on the bottom left of the plot could be outliers.*\n\nc)  Compute the correlation coefficient between `inperson_pct` and `pctTrump_2016`. Interpret the value in the context of the data.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    cor(nc_election$inperson_pct, nc_election$pctTrump_2016)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 0.3551753\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    *The value confirms our earlier conclusion that the relationship between the two variables is weak but still positive.*\n\n## Problem 2 (linear regression)\n\na)  Fit a linear model to understand the variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Write down the equation of the model.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    model_1<- lm(inperson_pct~pctTrump_2016, data=nc_election)\n    tidy(model_1)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    # A tibble: 2 x 5\n      term          estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n      <chr>            <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n    1 (Intercept)      0.402    0.0522      7.71 1.07e-11\n    2 pctTrump_2016    0.330    0.0877      3.76 2.88e- 4\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    $$\n    \\widehat{inperson\\_pct}=0.402+0.33\\times pctTrump\\_2016\n    $$\n\nb)  Interpret the slope of the model. The interpretation should be written in a way that is meaningful in the context of the data.\n\n    *The slope means that for every additional unit in the proportion of trump votes in 2016, the proportion of in person votes increase by 0.33 units.*\n\nc)  Does it make sense to interpret the intercept of the model? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the data. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.\n\n    *Yes. In this scenario, counties with 0 percent votes for Trump in 2016 would be expected to have about 40.2% in-person votes.*\n\nd)  Calculate the R-squared value for the model. Interpret the value of the R-squared in the context of the data.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    glance(model_1)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    # A tibble: 1 x 12\n      r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic  p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n          <dbl>         <dbl> <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n    1     0.126         0.117 0.120      14.1 0.000288     1   71.4 -137. -129.\n    # i 3 more variables: deviance <dbl>, df.residual <int>, nobs <int>\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    *Up to 12.6% of variability in the proportion of in-person votes in NC counties in 2020 can be explained by the percent of votes cast for Trump in 2016 in the counties.*\n\ne)  Use the linear model to predict the proportion of in-person votes in a county where 75% of the votes were cast for Trump in 2016.\n\n\n\n    ```{=tex}\n    \\begin{align*}\n    \\widehat{inperson\\_pct}&=0.402+0.33\\times pctTrump\\_2016\\\\\n    &=0.402+(0.33\\times 0.75)\\\\\n    &=0.6495\n    \\end{align*}\n    ```\n\n\n\n## Problem 3 (model diagnostics)\n\na)  Calculate the residuals for the linear model. Create a histogram of the residuals and describe the distribution of the residuals.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    #Augment the model and select the residuals column.\n    residuals<- model_1|> \n      augment()|> \n      select(.resid)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    #Create a histogram of the residuals\n    ggplot(data=residuals, aes(x=.resid))+\n      geom_histogram(fill=\"lightblue\", color=\"black\", binwidth=.05)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](ps-2_solution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    *The residuals appear to be roughly normally distributed and centered around 0.

Describe the relationship between the residuals and the fitted values.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    residual_plot <- model_1 |> \n      augment() |> \n      ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") # Add horizontal line at y=0\n    \n    print(residual_plot)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](ps-2_solution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # Can also run the plot() function.\n    plot(model_1)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](ps-2_solution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](ps-2_solution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-2.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](ps-2_solution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-3.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n    :::\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](ps-2_solution_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-4.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    *The residuals do not appear to make any clear pattern. They generally appear to vary uniformly along the red line with minor violations at the ends.*\n\nc)  Assuming that the cases (counties) in the dataset are independent, explain whether the assumptions of the linear regression model are met.\n\n    *First, linearity was satisfied because there is a general linear pattern in the scatter plot of the two variables. Second, the problem indicates that the cases (in this case counties) were independent. Third, the residuals were found to be nearly normally distributed. Lastly, equal variance (homoscedasticity) requirement was met as illustrated by the residual plot.*\n\n    *The assumptions are all satisfied.*\n\n## Problem 4 (categorical predictor)\n\nIn this problem, we will try to answer the question of whether counties with higher proportions of older voters (65 year plus) tend to lean republican. You will use the variable `pct65plus` that provides the proportion of voters in every county that were 65 or older.\n\na)  Create a new data set called `nc_election_b` by adding a binary variable called `senior_voters` with levels `high` and `low`. A county would be considered to have high rates of older voters if the proportion of voters 65 years or older was greater than or equal to 20% (0.2).\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    nc_election_b<- nc_election|>\n      mutate(senior_voters = ifelse(pct65plus>=.20, \"high\", \"low\"))\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\nb)  Fit a linear regression model to predict the proportion of 2016 trump votes based on the binary variable `senior_voters`.
