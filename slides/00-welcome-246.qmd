## Meet Inter. Stats

-   Statistics is an exciting discipline that draws useful insights from data.

-   We're going to learn to do this using a statistical programming language called `R` -- more on that later!

-   This is an intermediate statistics course, so the assumption is that you already know some basic concepts in statistics.

-   The first problem set will serve as a review of basic statistics concepts.

-   During the semester, I will make efforts to remind you of the most important concepts that are needed in the course.

# Software

## Why not just Excel?

# Course overview

## Homepage

<https://jmochogi.github.io/intermediate-stats/>

-   Most course materials (over 90%) will be posted here.
-   Links to Canvas, GitHub, RStudio website, etc.

## Course toolkit

All linked from the course website:

-   Access RStudio at [posit cloud](https://posit.cloud/)
-   Discussions: Canvas Discussion Forums
-   Assignment submission and feedback: Canvas Gradebook

## Workflow {.smaller}

-   Get introduce new content and prepare for lectures by completing the readings and/or watching the videos.
-   Check your understanding by completing CPA assignment
-   Attend class and participate actively to dive deeper into the material and learn how to apply it in the real-world contexts.
-   Practice what you've learned by completing the labs and problem sets.

## Exams {.smaller}

-   Two midterm exams.

-   Each exam comprised of two parts:

    -   In class: 55 minute in-class exam. Closed book, one sheet of notes (“cheat sheet”, no larger than A4, both sides, will be allowed **this must be prepared by you**) – 60% of the grade.

    -   Take home: The take home portion will comprise of data analysis is R. Copilot may be used, but all the prompts should be written down as comments. If the code produced is incorrect for some reason, state the errors and explain how you fixed them – 40% of the grade.

::: callout-caution
No make-up exams will be given. If you anticipate that you will miss an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
:::

## Projects {.smaller}

-   Two projects

-   Dataset of your choice (collect your own or use existing data), method of your choice.

-   Teamwork. Every team member must list their role in the project.

-   Presentation and write-up.

-   Peer review other team's work, peer evaluation for team contribution.

-   Some lab sessions may be allocated to working on projects, doing peer review, and getting feedback.

## Teams

-   Assigned randomly by prof. at beginning of semester
-   Will be shuffled mid-way into the semester with input from you
-   Project: Each team will meet to discuss another team's project and provide written feedback. Each team member can choose a specific role in peer review.
-   Expectations and roles
    -   Everyone is expected to contribute equal *effort*
    -   Everyone is expected to understand *all* code used to do the analyses of your report.
    -   Individual contribution evaluated by team members, my observations, etc.

See [course syllabus](https://jmochogi.github.io/intermediate-stats/course-syllabus.html#grading-policy) for how the final letter grade will be determined.

## Support

-   Attend open hours
-   Math Support Center (Will Hall rm. 209)
-   Ask and answer questions on the Canvas discussion forum
-   Reserve email for questions on personal matters and/or grades
-   Read the [course support](https://jmochogi.github.io/intermediate-stats/course-support.html) page

## Announcements

-   Posted on Canvas (Announcements tool) and/or sent via email, be sure to check both regularly.
-   I'll (try my best to) send a weekly update announcement each Friday, outlining the plan for the following week and reminding you what you need to do to stay on track.

## Diversity + Inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

::: incremental
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisors, and deans are excellent resources.
:::

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](https://www.ithaca.edu/student-accessibility-services) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

# Course policies

## Late work, mobile phones, . . .

-   We have policies!
