## How do I use my mobile device to scan a document to a pdf?

If you have an iPhone, you can use the Notes app to scan a document to a PDF. To do this, follow the following steps:

-   Open the Notes app

-   Create a new note and name it.

-   Tap the camera icon and select "Scan Documents". I suggest you use the manual capture option as this allows you to capture only once the camera is in focus.

-   Position your phone over the document and tap the shutter button. Make sure the camera is directly over the document and is in focus.

-   Continue to the next page if there are multiple pages.

-   Tap "Save" when you are finished scanning all the pages.

If you have an Android device, you can use the Google Drive app to scan a document to a PDF. To do this, follow the following steps:

-   Open the Google Drive app

-   Tap the "+" icon in the bottom right corner

-   Tap "Scan"

-   Position your phone over the document and tap the shutter button. Make sure the camera is directly over the document and is in focus.

-   Continue to the next page if there are multiple pages.

-   Tap the checkmark when you are finished scanning all the pages.

## How do I export my assignment PDF from RStudio to upload to Canvas?

Go to your *Files* tab, check the box next to the file you want to download, then click on the blue gear icon on the Files tab to reveal the drop down menu, and select *Export*... If you have selected multiple files to export, RStudio will zip them up into a single zip file for you. If you've selected just a single file, it will only download that. The downloaded file will go to wherever files you download off the internet goes on your computer (usually your Downloads folder).

## Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?

The short answer is, I'd rather you didn't, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we're using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the course TA are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you're working in the posit cloud. If you're working on your local setup, we can't guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we're happy to try.

If you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:

-   Download and install R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
-   Download and install RStudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
-   Install Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html>
-   Install Git: <https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html>
-   Install any necessary packages with `install.packages("xxx")`, where `xxx` is the name of the package.

And I'd like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is **not** a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the online computing environment ([posit cloud](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)).
